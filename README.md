## Overview

Benchmarkoor is a benchmarking tool for Ethereum execution clients. It runs standardized tests against multiple clients (Geth, Nethermind, Besu, Erigon, Reth, Nimbus) in isolated Docker containers and collects performance metrics.

## Docker Quickstart

The easiest way to get started is using Docker Compose:

Start the UI and API. By default the UI will be listening on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and the API on [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090).
The default login is: `admin` with password: `changeme`, which is configured in the  [config.example.docker.yaml](config.example.docker.yaml) configuration file

```bash
# Starts the UI (port 8080) and API (port 9090)
make docker-run

# Alternatively, you can also choose your own ports like
make docker-run UI_PORT=3000 API_PORT=9091
```

Next we'll run a benchmark. By default it will use the  [config.example.docker.yaml](config.example.docker.yaml) configuration file. By default, it just runs a subset of tests, via the `filter: bn128`. Have a look at the file and change it as you want. If you're just experimenting, you can leave it as it is.

To run the benchmark we can do the following:

```sh
# Run the default config.example.docker.yaml with all clients
make docker-run-benchmark

# Limit the client. In this case, just run geth
make docker-run-benchmark CLIENT=geth

# Run with your custom configuration
make docker-run-benchmark CONFIG=config.custom.yaml
```

After each run, if you refresh the UI, you should see new results there.

To stop the services:

```bash
make docker-down
```

## Development Quickstart

Build the binary
```sh
make build-core
```

Run the UI (On a different tab):
```sh
make run-ui
```

It should print the address where you can access it. By default it's http://localhost:5173/ .

To debug the UI against real data, point the dev server at a remote API. Create an API key on that deployment first (the `/api-keys` page in its UI), then:

```sh
BENCHMARKOOR_API=https://benchmarkoor-api.core.ethpandaops.io \
BENCHMARKOOR_API_KEY=bmk_... make run-ui
```

The dev server proxies `/api` to the remote host and adds the key to each request. The browser only talks to localhost, so CORS and login are not involved. Omit `BENCHMARKOOR_API_KEY` if the remote API allows anonymous reads.

Now we want to run benchmarkoor. We'll be using an example configuration file that contains some stateless tests. By default we'll be just running the `bn128` subset of that suite. Have a look at the config file for more details:
```sh
./bin/benchmarkoor run --config examples/configuration/config.stateless.eest.yaml
```

If you don't always want to build and run, you can also use it like this:

```sh
go run cmd/benchmarkoor/*.go run --config examples/configuration/config.stateless.eest.yaml
```

After the run, you should be able to see the results on the UI.

Note: If you want to limit your runs to a specific client that is on the config, you can either comment out those that you don't want, or use the `--limit-instance-client` flag. This allows you to limit the execution to certain clients. For example `--limit-instance-client=nethermind` would only run any instances that are of the `nethermind` client type.

Example:

```
./bin/benchmarkoor run \
      --config examples/configuration/config.stateless.eest.yaml \
      --limit-instance-client=nethermind
```
